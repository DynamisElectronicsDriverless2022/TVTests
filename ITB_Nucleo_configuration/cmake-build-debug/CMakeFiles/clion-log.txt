CMake Warning (dev) at acados/acados/CMakeLists.txt:69 (add_library):
  ADD_LIBRARY called with SHARED option but the target platform does not
  support dynamic linking.  Building a STATIC library instead.  This may lead
  to problems.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Deprecation Warning at acados/external/blasfeo/CMakeLists.txt:36 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
